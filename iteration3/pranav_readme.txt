sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev

first download the tgz file,
cd /path/to/your/tgz/file
tar -xvzf tina-version.tgz
cd tina-version.tgz


For bash (if you're using bash, which is the default shell for most Ubuntu installations):
Open the ~/.bashrc file in a text editor like nano:

nano ~/.bashrc

and add,

export PATH=$PATH:~/Downloads/tina-3.8.5/bin

then,

source ~/.bashrc

then,
which tina
which nd


will see the output,
/home/sanju-k-george/Downloads/tina-3.8.5/bin/tina
/home/sanju-k-george/Downloads/tina-3.8.5/bin/nd

then python3 code1.py (make sure python environment is global, else create a virtual environment in that folder)
install lxml dependency using pip3


then take the output generated by the code1.py(which is a pnml file and the tina analysis) as an input to the visualize.py, this file has two functions one of which creates a .dot file, the second of which takes the input .dot file and outputs an image, which we can use to visualise the graph
